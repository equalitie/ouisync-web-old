## Secure file-sharing and real-time sync, with or without internet.

OuiSync is a free and open source tool enabling file sync and backups between devices, peer-to-peer.

### Features

- **Easy to use:** Simply install and quickly create files and folders to sync and share with trusted devices, contacts and/or groups. 
- **Free for everyone:** no in-app purchases, no subscriptions, no ads, and no tracking!
- **Offline-first:** OuiSync uses an innovative, synchronous, peer-to-peer design that allows users to access and share files and folders whether or not your device can connect to the internet.
- **Secure:** End-to-end encrypted files and folders - both in transit and at rest - secured by established, state-of-the art protocols.
- **Access Controls:** Create repositories that can be shared as read-write, read-only, or blind (you store files for others, but cannot access them).
